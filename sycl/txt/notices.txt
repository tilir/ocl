(1) GEMM: local size=1 increases but local size=16 decreases time compared to simple iteration
(2) Histogram: we can see difference in stateful vs stateless memory
(3) Filter: difference is really huge sampler-using filter works several times faster
            local memory almost equalizes things
(4)
